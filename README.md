## Advent of Code 2016

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of 
Code 2016 done in Python.

My goal through this coding experience is to establish
a fundamental understanding of the Python language. As
such, the comments in these programs, especially the
first several, will likely be verbose and the code may
not follow best practices. I'm excited to finally put 
a focus on learning the language and share my progress.
